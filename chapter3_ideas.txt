Villain concept:
"The Murmurer watches unseen, a voice in leaves and wind, luring wanderers deeper until they forget who they were."

Clue for Elara:
"Scorched rune, broken and oldâ€”bind the voice, or be unmade. The rest lies buried where the trees no longer speak."

Silly idea for Chronomancer's Cipher:
Elara meets Squeaky, a time-traveling squirrel who speaks in riddles and hoards acorns... from the future. He demands snacks.
