1. The Language of Ancient Runes
Etched in spirals and shifting lines, Ancient Runes form a living script responsive to thought and intent. Only Chronomancers can decipher its true meaning, 
for the runes rearrange with time’s flow. Speaking them aloud can bend moments—pause rainfall, reverse footsteps, or unveil secrets buried in history’s depths.


2. The Griffin of the Sky Peaks
Perched atop jagged cliffs, the Sky Peaks Griffin guards the realm between storm and stars. With feathers of lightning and eyes of molten gold, it tests the worthy. 
Legend claims it obeys only those who’ve glimpsed time’s thread unravel—making it both sentinel and reluctant guide to the Cipher’s final key.
