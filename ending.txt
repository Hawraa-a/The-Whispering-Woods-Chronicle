Elara returned from the Whispering Woods with the mystery of the map unraveled and the ancient pact between forest and village restored. 
The trees no longer whispered warnings but welcomed her with golden light, and soon Eldenbrook flourished—its crops thriving, its waters pure, 
and its people no longer afraid. With the Chronicle's magic rekindled, Elara became a quiet guardian of both land and lore, 
her journey bringing lasting peace and prosperity to all.

Elara was never seen again after entering the Whispering Woods, though the villagers often spoke of faint lights flickering between the trees and distant songs
 carried on the wind. Years passed, and while the forest seemed calmer—less cruel—the map never reappeared, and the hearth where she found it went cold. 
Some say Elara solved the mystery and chose to remain, bound to the forest by ancient magic. Others believe the Chronicle claimed her, as it had others before. 
Eldenbrook endured, but the woods kept her secret—and whispered her name when the wind turned.

Elara never returned to Eldenbrook, but the forest changed after her journey—its shadows softened, and the once-hostile paths grew quiet, almost watchful. 
Seasons passed, and though the villagers mourned, strange blessings followed: fields grew richer, the sick recovered quickly,
 and children spoke of a lantern glowing deep among the trees. Some believed Elara had become part of the woods, neither lost nor truly gone, 
a guardian woven into the Chronicle’s ancient magic. The map was never found again, but the forest no longer whispered warnings—only lullabies.
