After days weaving through the ancient forest’s secrets, Elara finally reached the heart of the Whispering Woods—a hidden glade bathed in golden light. 
There, she uncovered a forgotten spring whose waters shimmered with healing magic, the source of the village’s old legends. Returning to Eldenbrook with the map’s truth, 
she shared the spring’s gift, and soon crops flourished, wounds healed, and hope blossomed. The village thrived once more, 
and Elara’s name became a legend whispered alongside the forest’s gentle songs—proof that courage and curiosity could bring light even to the darkest woods.
