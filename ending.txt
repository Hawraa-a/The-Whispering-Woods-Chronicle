Elara returned from the Whispering Woods with the mystery of the map unraveled and the ancient pact between forest and village restored. 
The trees no longer whispered warnings but welcomed her with golden light, and soon Eldenbrook flourishedâ€”its crops thriving, its waters pure, 
and its people no longer afraid. With the Chronicle's magic rekindled, Elara became a quiet guardian of both land and lore, 
her journey bringing lasting peace and prosperity to all.
