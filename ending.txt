After days weaving through the ancient forest’s secrets, Elara finally reached the heart of the Whispering Woods—a hidden glade bathed in pale, eerie light. 
There, she uncovered a forgotten spring whose waters shimmered with strange, unsettling magic. Though she brought the news back to Eldenbrook,
the village soon found the land withering and the skies darkening. The magic was powerful—but costly. Elara’s name became a somber legend, 
a reminder that some mysteries come with a price too heavy to bear.
