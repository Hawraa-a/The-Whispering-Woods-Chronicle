Elara was never seen again after entering the Whispering Woods, though the villagers often spoke of faint lights flickering between the trees and distant songs
 carried on the wind. Years passed, and while the forest seemed calmer—less cruel—the map never reappeared, and the hearth where she found it went cold.

Eldenbrook endured, but the woods kept her secret—and whispered her name when the wind turned.
